# es6-boilerplate

A small and lean skeleton to get you started building ES6 apps in no time.

### How do I get set up?

First of all you'll have to install [Node.js](href:https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](href:https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Upon completion simply run these commands in your terminal of choice:

* `git clone git@github.com:techouse/es6-boilerplate.git`
* `cd es6-boilerplate`
* `yarn`
* `yarn run watch`
* `yarn run start`

### Where do I go from here?

Well, now fire up your IDE of choice, navigate to the `src` directory and start editing `main.js` and exploring the wonders of ES6.
